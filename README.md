This is Alpha!!!
================

Please always keep in mind: This is an alpha version; alpha < beta

This means:

- There might be commits, that won't compile.
- There might be commits, that compile, but won't run at all on any device.
- There are no clear commit rules yet, i.e. a commit can contain multiple features or none at all.
- Don't install this app on your device yet, if you like your device the way it is -- working.

As soon as we will reach a beta status with the app, all these problems will be gone.
